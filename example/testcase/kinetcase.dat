# kinetic model 
the cell uptakes m_A_e via p_TA_c
the cell secretes m_B_c via p_TB_c
the cell secretes m_C_c via p_TC_c
p_E1_c catalyzes the conversion of m_A_c into m_B_c
p_E4_c catalyzes the conversion of m_B_c into m_A_c
p_E2_c catalyzes the conversion of m_A_c into m_C_c
p_E3_c catalyzes the conversion of m_C_c into m_B_c
m_A_e activates p_TA_c
m_A_c induces g_E1_c and g_E2_c
m_B_c induces g_TB_c and g_E4_c
m_C_c induces g_E3_c and g_TC_c

m_, p_, mRNA_, g_ are METABOLITE, PROTEIN, MRNA, GENE
_e, _c are _exc, _c
