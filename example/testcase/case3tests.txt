# general test cases
the cell uptakes m_A_e
[] catalyzes the reversible conversion of m_A_c into m_B_c
[] catalyzes the conversion of m_A_c into m_C_c
the cell secretes m_B_c
p_E1_c phosphorylates p_E2_c
p_E3_c dephosphorylate p_E2_c-phos
p_E1_c phosphorylates p_E2_c at site xyz
p_E4_c dephosphorylate p_E2_c-xyz at site xyz

p_E4_c and p_E5_c binding
p_E6_c and p_E7_c binding into p_Bind_c
3*p_E4_c binds into p_E4Bind_c
p_E4_c-p_E5_c unbind into p_E4_c and p_E5_c

-phos is -pho
m_, p_, mRNA_ are METABOLITE, PROTEIN, MRNA
_e, _c are _exc, _c
