## Introduction
SEML compiler is a code generator that transforms simplified English description of biological network into modeling written in a runnable programming language, such as the [Julia](http://julialang.org), [Python](https://www.python.org) and [Matlab](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html).
See our [Github page](https://github.com/varnerlab/SEML.git)


## Installation
**Requirement**.
In order to use SEML, the user needs to [install Julia](https://julialang.org/downloads/platform.html) first. 

**Installation**.
Within Julia, press `]` to enter `pkg>` mode.
To install SEML.jl, issue
```julia
add https://github.com/varnerlab/SEML.git
```
To use SEML in your project simply issue the command:
```julia
using SEML
```

**Test**.
To test SEML installation, use the following command in `pkg>` mode:
```julia
test SEML
```

**Uninstallation**.
To delete SEML package use the following command in `pkg>` mode:
```julia
rm SEML
```


## API Documentation 
To use SEML in your project simply issue the command:

```julia 
using SEML
make_model(in_path[, out_path=arg2, host=arg3, model=arg4, lang=arg5])
```

The ``make_model()`` command takes five arguments:

Argument | Required | Description | Options | Default
:--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :---
in_path | Yes | path to input file | | none
out_path | No	| path to where files are written | | ./autogeneratedmodel
host | No	| host type  | bacterial \| mammalian | bacterial
model | No | model type | FBA \| FVA \| Kinetics \| rFBA | Kinetics
lang | No | programming language | julia \| python \| python2 \| python3 \| matlab | julia

The default solvers in SEML generated codes: 

Language | Constraint-based model | Kinetic model 
:--- | :--- | :--- 
Julia | ode23 in [ODE.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDiffEq/ODE.jl) | [GLPK.jl](https://github.com/JuliaOpt/GLPK.jl) 
Python | scipy.integrate.odeint | scipy.optimize.linprog
Matlab | builtin ode23 | GLPK

## Reproduce Examples
The following Julia packages are required to run the demontration examples in Julia:
* [GLPK](https://github.com/JuliaOpt/GLPK.jl)
* [ODE](https://github.com/JuliaDiffEq/ODE.jl)
* [PyPlot](https://github.com/JuliaPy/PyPlot.jl)

They can be installed by running in Julia:

```julia
using Pkg
]
(v1.1) pkg> add GLPK ODE PyPlot
```
### reproduce directly
1. Download the `example` folder
2. Open a terminal window, `cd` to the `example` folder
3. To run the FBA model (Fig. 2):
  - `cd` to `fauto` folder
  - run `julia Solve.jl`
3. To run the kinetic model (Fig. 5):
  - `cd` to `kiauto` folder
  - run `julia Simulation.jl`
  (Note that while running the kinetic model, some figure(s) will be generated and pause the program, close the unwanted figure windows to get the final color figures as Fig. 5.)

### reproduce from scratch
1. Download the `example/testcase` folder to get two models in SEML
2. Open a terminal window, go into `julia` and run `using SEML`
3. To build the FBA model (Fig. 2):
  - run `make_model("PathTo/fbacase.txt", model="FBA", out_path="outpath1")`
  - change the following parameters to corresponding values in the generated `DataDictionary.jl`
  ```julia
  default_bounds_array = [
	...
	0 1.0; # 2 1.0*m_A_c<catalyze:>1.0*m_B_c
	0 1.0; # 3 1.0*m_B_c<catalyze:>1.0*m_A_c
	0 2.0; # 4 1.0*m_A_c<catalyze:>1.0*m_C_c
        ...
  ]
  ...julia
  species_bounds_array = [
	-10.0 10.0; # 1 m_A_e
	-10.0 10.0; # 2 m_B_e
	-10.0 10.0; # 3 m_C_e
	 ...
  ]
  ```
  - `cd` to `outpath1` folder
  - run `julia Solve.jl`

4. To build the kinetic model (Fig. 4 and 5):
  - run `make_model("PathTo/kinetcase.dat", out_path="outpath2")`
  - change the following parameters to corresponding values in the generated `DataDictionary.jl`
  ```julia
  kcat_signaling = ones(7)  # kcat[#reaction]: reaction name
  kcat_signaling[1] = 1.1e-3  # kcat: 1.0*m_A_e<uptake:1.0*p_TA_c>1.0*m_A_c
